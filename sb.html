    <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
    Start: Various
    Languages: C++
    Repository's: <a href="https://github.com/maxrchung/Tegami" target="_blank">Tegami</a><br>
    <a href="https://github.com/maxrchung/Drain" target="_blank">Drain</a>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    A music video for the rhythm game, osu!.

    You can take a look at the finished product to get an idea of what a storyboard is:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lswQFsqZj24" target="_blank">Drain</a>
    and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JjaWetNblY" target="_blank">Tegami</a>.

    The goal is for there also to be a game to play, with the video playing in the background.

    If you want a better idea of osu! itself, there should be plenty of videos on YouTube.<br>

    But before I get to the project you can read a more detailed write-up of the project as a
    whole from the project leader
    <a href="http://maxrchung.com/projects/tegami" target="_blank">here</a>.

    I'll only talk a little bit of the relevant work I did, since some of these projects had
    some random side things, and other people were working on other parts of the project.<br>

    Max (the author of the more detailed write-up) is also the author of the C++ storyboard
    library that all these projects end up using.

    It was originally written for use with MS Visual C++, and I used Windows for a little
    bit to work on the project for Tegami.

    But when working on Drain, my copy of Windows 10 didn't want to be stable
    (it keeps blue screening!!!), so I got the library working on Linux with make.

    These projects are the first time that I collaboratively work on a project with someone
    as well, so in addition to learning C++, I'm learning the process of working with other
    people (a first!)
