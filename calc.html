    <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
    Start: Feb. 2017<br>
    Languages: C, Python (testing)<br>
    <a href="https://www.github.com/royces9/calculator" target="_blank">Github</a>
    
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    A calculator for use in terminals.

    Supports basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division),
    exponents (exponentiation, logarithms, square roots),
    trigonometry (sin(), cos(), tan()),
    numerical approximations (derivatives, integrals, equation solver),
    and more.

    Written for use in Linux, and requires the GNU Readline library to run,
    and GNU make to build.

    Testing after changes are done by hand if small.

    Bigger changes (i.e. changes to parsing) are tested
    with test cases using Python.

    Memory correctness is checked with Valgrind, and deubgging is done
    with print statements/GDB.

    <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
    This was my first programming project.

    I was trying out Linux around the beginning of 2017 because Windows 10
    was too frustrating for me too use.

    Since I didn't really play games anymore anyway, I decided to try out Debian.

    Now, I had actually taken an intro to C course my first year of undergrad, and
    actually really enjoyed it (EECS 10 with Sheu). 

    For some reason, I realized that if I'm on Linux, I would have a C compiler, and
    that I'd have no excuse to not know how to program (looking back this is kind of
    stupid, but it doesn't matter now I guess).

    I decided to start dabbling here and there with C, just writing small test programs
    to get used to syntax, and the compiling toolchain; although at this point it was
    basically stuff like: <code>gcc test.c -o test</code>.

    At some point, I wanted to make something more interesting, but I couldn't think of
    anything at the top of my head.<br>

    As I was doing homework, I had to do some quick arithmetic, nothing too difficult,
    but not something I could do mentally.

    So I opened up a tab on my browser with Google and put in my query and got my answer.

    I reflexively close the tab, get to the next question, re-open another Google tab, and
    repeat.

    The easy solution is to not close the tab, but if I have a tab open with, let's say
    physical data for fluid densities (chemical engineering btw), switching tabs is also
    kind of annoying.

    I somewhat had a solution for this on my laptop (which also had Linux installed), where
    I had a student license of MATLAB installed.

    This actually did what I wanted perfectly, you can actually open MATLAB without a GUI,
    and just have the CLI, but it was frustratingly slow, and if I only wanted to do something
    simple like 45 * 34, it took too long for what I got out of it.

    With these two annoyances, and a want for a project, I started work on the calculator.

    As an aside, I could have possibly used Octave, software similar to MATLAB, but free; or used
    a Python shell with small modifications (i.e. from import math *, to get rid of namespace), but
    those didn't come to mind at the time (I even knew about Octave).

    <h3>Things Learned and Problems</h3>
    As this was my first programming project, there was a lot to learn.

    I'll split things up into smaller sections within this section, in order of
    how important the skills were, and any problems I ran into.
    
    <h4>C</h4>
    Starting off, like any beginner, I had no idea what I was doing.

    I had one class of intro C four years prior, so I was mostly working with knowledge
    I retained from that class, it's not much, but I had a start.

    Also unlike most people nowadays, I had zero experience in higher level languages like
    Python and Java.

    I think this ended up helping me a little bit since I didn't already have a mental model of
    how programs are "supposed" to work. <br>

    The first issue I ran into was handling order of operations.

    I had no idea how to start with differentiating between 1 + 2 * 3 and 1 * 2 + 3, how do I
    tell my program program you have to do * first in that case?

    Many of my friends (all from osu! UCI) were computer science majors so I figured I'd ask them,
    which left me with most questions after they'd start talking about grammars and tokens and other
    stuff I didn't really understand at the time, I just wanted things to go in order!

    I don't know how I found it, but I probably Googled it and found the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm" target="_blank">Shunting-yard algorithm</a>.

    I won't go into detail of the algorithm here, but the basic idea of the algorithm was perfect
    for me because it was simple to understand and implement. <br>

    And to get an idea of what one of the earlier iterations of the calculator looked like check
    <a href="https://github.com/royces9/calculator/blob/6a6de9348d5d882dd03974b7539f92a5b4791809/calcx.c" target="_blank">this</a>
    out.

    Apparently it compiled. I'm not sure how looking at it now, but hey, at least I've improved.

    Things to note that I think are funny: all the #defines, how horrifying; ch, bch, bbch, bbbch,
    ach, oh god why; consecutive ifs in some of the cases.

    At this point, I had never used Git and thought it was the same thing as Github, so I was making changes,
    uploading onto Google drive, and hoping I remembered to upload the changes if I was on a different computer.

    I also numbered each update so that I could "save" previous versions, at one point I was writing the date
    I made the changes in the source file.

    I did this for a couple months, then realized I should learn Git, since that's the cool thing to do.<br>

    After setting up Git and Github, development went much smoother, and opened up the path for more files,
    since updating multiple files using the Google drive method is obviously not going to work very well.

    The problem was that I didn't really know how to combine multiple files into one executable.

    Up until this point, I was typing out (or running through history) <code>gcc calc.c -o calc</code> and
    running the executable.

    I was told about makefiles and got to learning how to make them.

    I was able to make one after some trouble, but there were a lot of
    issues with it until fairly recently.

    But, for the time being, it worked, and that's all I cared about
    at the time.<br>

    After this point, I was confident in what I was doing (at a basic level, anyway), and was thinking
    of lots of different functionality for my calculator.
    
    One of the more major changes, that took me quite a while to implement was the transition from scalars
    to vectors and matrices.

    For my research as a graduate student, a lot of the computational work was done using MATLAB, and so
    I was very comfortable with writing "vectorized" code with MATLAB, and because of that, I felt that
    it would be beneficial to put in matrices and vectors into my calculator.

    The biggest issue that I was "scared" of was dynamic memory allocation.

    <code>malloc</code> was just a scary concept up until that point, and I never thought about what was going
    on with memory usage in my program.

    Arrays were also allocated with some set amount, usually 1024, and I didn't realize it the time, but I
    didn't understand pointers at all (it's just an address, how can it be so hard???).

    I bit the bullet, and started using malloc, to allocate just the right amount of memory for each matrix.

    This led to a big rewrite of almost every static allocated array to be a heap object instead.

    This lead to an obvious next problem. Memory leaks.

    While I was implementing my malloc changes, I put frees in as I felt necessary, but how would I check
    for memory leaks?

    I looked around and found Valgrind, which did exactly what I wanted.

    There was a slight learning curve with Valgrind, but otherwise, it was pretty straight forward.

    One thing that I didn't have for a while was the line numbers for the exact location of invalid
    reads/writes, all I needed was the -g flag, but I didn't even know there was line number information
    until a little bit after using it.<br>

    The issue that went along with dynamic memory allocation were pointers.

    Conceptually, the concept of a pointer is really simple, it's hard to imagine why anyone would screw it
    up, but almost everyone does when first learning about pointers, and I was no exception.

    Because each of my <code>struct matrix</code>'s were going to be large (more than 8 bytes), I decided to
    pass them around as pointers instead of the raw struct. 

    I actually flip-flopped on this decision for a little bit, but decided (hopefully correctly) that passing
    them as pointers would be the best decision.

    Changing a bunch of <code>double</code>s to <code>struct matrix *</code>s was the easy part, now making
    sure I was actually accessing the correct matrix and its elements was some what difficult.
    
    I ended up making it through; Valgrind came in strong here, and I can confidently say that normal operation
    has zero memory leaks and no invalid reads or writes.<br>

    Past that, as I add features, I learn more about the C language, and other random little bits here and there.

    <h4>Git</h4>
    This project was the first opportunity for me to use Git.

    Sadly, because I was the only one working on the project, I don't build good practices on pushing and what not,
    but that's what practice is for right (yikes)?

    Anyway, I learn the basics. Pull, commit, push. The trifecta.

    There's some other commands you need to do to start out, like clone and init, but Github and Git are really helpful
    with telling you what to do incase you need to do something "weird" (i.e. something that's not the trifecta).

    When I started my WIP branch, I would also get merge conflicts which, I think, were good practice for handling
    what was going on, although I didn't really understand what was going on until a little later, when I used
    Git collaboratively.

    As far as more advanced features, I don't really use them for this project, since an individual project doesn't
    really need anything too fancy, except maybe branches.

    <h4>Make</h4>
    Just like Git, I'd say that this project didn't really get into understanding make, but it at least
    introduced me to Make, and how to make a Makefile, as well as introduce the concept of partial compilation of
    multiple files (although I didn't understand it until much later into the project).

    My first makefile was very rudimentary, with explicitly typed out rules for each different source file, and
    dependencies typed out by hand, it worked exactly how it should have.

    Files only compiled when they needed to be, and otherwise updated when they should have (I think).

    Things started to suck when I wanted to add new files, since I would, by hand, add a new rule, and its
    dependencies to the makefile, at one point, I renamed some files too, so I had to remove them as well.

    I ended up not changing it until I implemented a better makefile for one of my other projects, but once again,
    this project ended up as a good intro to makefiles.

    <h4>Valgrind and GDB</h4>
    As mentioned earlier, after implementing <code>malloc</code>, Valgrind came in clutch to find memory leaks
    and fix invalid reads/writes.

    I only really use the basics for Valgrind, <code>--leak-checks=full</code> kinda stuff, but it's so general
    that I use it for any other C project, which has been very helpful.<br>

    Now GDB is useful too, I like using it, but I have to admit, it does take some getting used to, and I'm
    still getting used to it.

    I used it quite a bit in my operating systems class (CS143A), so I learned quite a bit about using GDB
    through that class, and I use it when I can in my calculator project, but mentally, it's still easier
    for me to debug with print statements and Valgrind (especially if I'm debugging a segfault).

    This is of course, just practice, but it'll take time.
