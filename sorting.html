  <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
  Start: Oct. 2017<br>
  Languages: C, Python (testing)<br>
  <a href="https://www.github.com/royces9/sortingalgorithms" target="_blank">Github</a>
  
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  A bunch of different sorting algorithm implementations in C.

  There are a bunch of different algorithms, and also a bunch of
  different flags for different run modes, including timing, printing
  the array, a visual representation, and counting compares.
  
  <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
  If you haven't watched visualizations of a bunch of different sorting algorithms,
  you should definitely check
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg" target="_blank">some out</a>.

  Something about seeing those bars move around, and then the sounds slowly getting into
  place is really cool.

  The main motivation for this was twofold: I wanted to make my own visualization, since
  that's what got me into sorting algorithms in the first place, and I wanted to practice
  some more algorithmic stuff, since I didn't have the coursework to supplement (I did
  end up taking an algorithms course though, so having some knowledge of this stuff
  helped a little).

  <h3>Things Learned and Problems</h3>
  I'll talk about implementing sorting algorithms, and then some of the
  auxillary knowledge that came with implementation.

  <h4>Sorting algorithms</h4>
  All in all, this project really helped with my overall skills in problem solving.

  I put an artificial limitation on myself to not look at any source/pseudo code for
  any sorting algorithms.

  To implement one, I would read a description of the algorithm, and look at the
  visualization.

  This ended up being a good exercise because sorting algorithms are so well studied,
  so when I went back later to see specifically how some algorithms are implemented,
  I made some correct choices, and other not so correct choices (My first implementation
  of quicksort was not inplace!).

  It was cool to see that merging using pointers for read/write heads, or Sedgewick's
  quicksort were things that existed already. <br>

  Implementing each separate algorithm was its own challenge, especially the different
  ones, like heapsort, or the radix sorts, which had a much different way of thinking
  than say, insertion sort or mergesort.

  I also tried to implement my own different sorting algorithms, of the two I've done
  they aren't particularly good.

  One is an inplace-merge that merges using weaving, array elements are merged by
  alternating array elements, then insertion sort is applied to the weaved array.

  This can (with effort) be done in place, but runs in O(n^2) worst case, anyway,
  it's way slower than heapsort.

  It's stable though, so that's kinda cool right? <br>

  The other implements a double-ended queue which prepends elements if it's smaller
  than the first element, and appends elements if it's bigger than the last element.

  If those two conditions aren't fulfilled, a new queue is made, this is repeated
  until all the elements of the array are in a queue.

  Queues are merged until the array is sorted.

  I'm not sure on its complexity, but it's kind of slow.<br>

  <h4>Other stuff</h4>
  There's quite a few auxillary things I ended up doing for this project.

  I'll split it by topic.

  <h5>Make</h5>
  Because I wanted each sort to be separate from each of the other sorts, I ended up
  making a separate executable for each sorting algorithm.

  I wrote a separate rule for each sorting algorithm, as well as a rule for each of the
  source files that would be used for each algorithm (like the main function).

  An issue that I ran into later on was that everytime I ran make, I would be recompiling
  everything, which completely defeats one of the purposes make.

  This initially wasn't an issue, but when I went to implement SDL visualizations, compile
  times were taking too long for my liking.

  Because of this, I first wanted to make sure only the things that needed to be compiled,
  would be compiled.

  Changing the makefile actually ended up being a massive undertaking, because I had to
  redo the makefile to be written correctly, using a general rule for making each of the
  sorting algorithms object files.

  This was also when I actually started to understand what was going on in the compilation
  proess for multi-file projects.

  I had already made the make file for my calculator, but I didn't really have a good
  understanding of what object files were, and what was going on with linking and all
  that.

  With this, I was able to understand to a better degree how the compilation process
  works, as well as making a more general makefile for my project.

  After I made the makefile for sorting, I went ahead and updated my makefile for my
  calculator, and any other multifile projects I had.
  
  <h5>Python</h5>
  For this section, I'll only talk about the test and automation scripts I used, and
  not the visualization.

  As I was making each of my sorting algorithms, I wanted to be able to compare them
  against each other and see how they stood up against each other.

  I figured that using Python would be a good starting project since the task at hand
  was fairly simple.

  I had my C programs print the execution time given the correct flag, and had
  Python read it from stdout using subprocess.

  The script could also rerun algorithms multiple times to give an average of
  all the runs it ran.

  I also wanted to be able to confirm that sorting was correct; that I wrote my program
  correctly.

  This was easy, since I have a flag in the C program that prints if the array is not
  sorted correctly after sorting, so I just have subprocess check if there is something
  in stdout.<br>

  There are a few other little scripts like a plot script using matplotlib, and counting
  functions that count the number of swaps or compares used, the concept is the same in
  most of these other scripts; there's some flag that you can set in the C program that
  is used in subprocess.

  <h5>C</h5>
  There were a few things about C that I learned through this project.

  It was my first time using function pointers (for the comparison function),
  using void pointers as a "general" pointer to any sort of data, and using pthreads.

  I was actually not using the comparison function correctly for a little bit, I was
  including the header file of the compare into the sort function's source, but I've
  since fixed that.

  The void pointers too, I changed to <code>char *</code> since pointer arithmetic with
  void pointers is technically undefined behaviour by the standard.

  This was my first time using pthreads, so I think the implementing threads in mergesort
  was a good intro to pthreads, since I didn't have to think of any race conditions,
  complicated lock situations, or other things people worry about with threads.

  The hardest part by far, was being able to set up a variable amount of threads depending
  on some run-time value; it wasn't hard that I had to think a lot, but I had to be careful
  about making sure that I split arrays correctly.

  But making these changes, and learning from them is part of the learning process right?
  
  <h5>Visualization</h5>
  The visualization process actually took quite a while, and in two steps.

  The bar visualization, I first implemented in Python using Tkinter.

  As this was my first time going into visual stuff, I worked through Tkinter
  docs and tutorials slowly.

  It's a much different paradigm than, say, the shell like stuff I'd
  been wokring on before.

  One issue I had was figuring out how to get my program in C to do something
  in Python.

  I had used the subprocess module in my test scripts, so for the visualization,
  I planned to print to stdout and have the Python script update accordingly.

  I had issues with this because the speed of execution of the algorithm mismatched
  the speed of Python, and I wanted to alter the C program as little as possible, so
  I didn't want to tell it to wait.

  The solution I came up with was to run the sort, and have it print to a file with the
  state of the array every time a swap occured.

  Once the sort is done, Python reads the file and updates the visualization by line,
  it deletes the file once it's done sorting, and repeats the process.

  The speed of the visualization of the sort is basically set by the number of swaps,
  which leads to obvious problems, selection sort is always going to be the fastest,
  when it's actual run time is slower.

  Despite those issues, I felt that it was fine to at least understand what the sort
  was doing. <br>

  After a while, I took a little break and worked on a little side project which
  involved SDL.

  It was suprisingly easy to just get a rectangle on the screen: surprise, surprise,
  that's exactly what these sort visualizations are anyway.

  So I learned a little bit more about SDL and made some adaptions to the code I
  wrote for my other project for this one.

  After those changes, there was still a problem with the sort time not matching
  the visualization time, so I also added a colour change to occur when a comparison
  occurs to hopefully balance out the times a little bit, and that worked perfectly.

  It also gave a very useful look into what was being compared against what, which
  made sorts like quick sort pretty interesting, because of its constant comparison
  to the pivot.
