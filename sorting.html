  <h3>Quick Glance</h3>
  Start: Oct. 2017<br>
  Languages: C, Python (testing)<br>
  <a href="https://www.github.com/royces9/sortingalgorithms" target="_blank">Github</a>
  
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  A bunch of different sorting algorithm implementations in C.

  There are a bunch of different algorithms, and also a bunch of
  different flags for different run modes, including timing, printing
  the array, a visual representation, and counting compares.
  
  <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
  If you haven't watched visualizations of a bunch of different sorting algorithms,
  you should definitely check
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg" target="_blank">some out</a>.

  Something about seeing those bars move around, and then the sounds slowly getting into
  place is really cool.

  The main motivation for this was twofold: I wanted to make my own visualization, since
  that's what got me into sorting algorithms in the first place, and I wanted to practice
  some more algorithmic stuff, since I think it's good to have some of that knowledge.

  <h3>Things Learned and Problems</h3>
  I'll talk about implementing sorting algorithms, and then some of the
  auxillary knowledge that came with implementation.
